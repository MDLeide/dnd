Often times a screen has a lifecycle associated with it which allows the screen to perform custom 
activation and deactivation logic. This is what Jeremy calls the ScreenActivator. For example, 
take the Visual Studio code editor window. If you are editing a C# code file in one tab, then you 
switch to a tab containing an XML document, you will notice that the toolbar icons change. Each 
one of those screens has custom activation/deactivation logic that enables it to setup/teardown 
the application toolbars such that they provide the appropriate icons based on the active screen.
